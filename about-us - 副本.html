			<h2>Foundation Governance</h2>
			<p>On the basis its application to the NSW Government, Department of Fair Trading is approved, the Zamasa Foundation will be registered as an Incorporated Association. It will be governed by its constitution (effectively a contract between the association and its members), which for the Zamasa Foundation is based on the NSW Office of Fair Trading’s model constitution.</p>
			<p>Incorporation benefits an association and its members, however, it also brings a number of responsibilities. Committee members and the public officer are primarily responsible for ensuring an incorporated association complies with its statutory and reporting obligations. Failure to comply with these obligations may lead to the issue of a penalty notice, prosecution, or in some instances, cancellation of the association's incorporation </p>
